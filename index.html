                <h3>Waymo Self-Driving Cars Begin Operating Without Safety Drivers</h3>
                <div class="card-content">
                    <p><strong>The milestone:</strong> Waymo announced today that its autonomous vehicles in Phoenix and San Francisco are now operating completely driverless during peak hours, marking the first major robotaxi service to eliminate human safety operators entirely. The company's fleet of 2,400 vehicles completed over 50 million autonomous miles before reaching this milestone.</p>
                    <p><strong>The expansion:</strong> CEO Tekedra Mawakana revealed plans to expand fully autonomous operations to Los Angeles and Austin by Q3 2026, with regulatory approval already secured in both markets. Waymo's AI driving system, powered by custom TPU chips, processes 1.4 petabytes of sensor data daily across the fleet.</p>
                    <p><strong>The competition:</strong> This development puts significant pressure on Cruise, Uber, and Tesla's Full Self-Driving program, all of which still require human oversight. Industry analysts predict fully autonomous rideshare could capture 15% of urban transportation by 2028, representing a $40 billion market opportunity.</p>

                <h3>Artists Sue Midjourney Over New 'Style Theft' Feature</h3>
                <div class="card-content">
                    <p><strong>The lawsuit:</strong> A coalition of 200 artists filed a class-action lawsuit against Midjourney today, claiming the company's new 'Artist DNA' feature directly copies and monetizes their distinctive styles without consent. The feature allows users to generate art 'in the style of' specific living artists by name, including detailed brushwork and signature techniques.</p>
                    <p><strong>The evidence:</strong> Legal documents include side-by-side comparisons showing Midjourney outputs nearly identical to original works by plaintiffs, including digital artist Loish and concept artist Craig Mullins. The artists claim Midjourney scraped millions of copyrighted images from Instagram, ArtStation, and DeviantArt without permission or compensation.</p>
                    <p><strong>The implications:</strong> If successful, the suit could force AI art generators to pay licensing fees or remove style-copying features entirely. Midjourney's stock price dropped 12% in after-hours trading, while competitors like Stability AI and Adobe are reportedly reviewing their own style-mimicking capabilities.</p>

                <h3>AI Assistants Struggle with Context Switching, Users Report</h3>
                <div class="card-content">
                    <p><strong>The problem:</strong> Users across ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are reporting frustrating experiences when trying to switch topics mid-conversation, with AI assistants clinging to previous context inappropriately. Common complaints include recipe assistants suddenly injecting coding advice and travel planners referencing earlier discussions about medical symptoms.</p>
                    <p><strong>The user backlash:</strong> A viral Reddit thread titled 'Why can't AI just forget?' has garnered 45,000 upvotes, with users sharing screenshots of bizarre context bleeding. Professional users report having to start new conversations dozens of times daily, defeating the purpose of persistent chat sessions and leading some to abandon AI assistants entirely.</p>
                    <p><strong>The technical challenge:</strong> The issue stems from transformer architectures that treat all conversation history equally, making it difficult to determine when context should be preserved versus discarded. Major AI labs are reportedly working on 'attention masking' techniques, but solutions may not arrive until late 2026, leaving millions of users frustrated with current implementations.</p>

                <h3>AI Researchers Debate Whether LLMs Actually 'Understand' Language</h3>
                <div class="card-content">
                    <p><strong>The spark:</strong> NYU professor Gary Marcus ignited a heated Twitter debate yesterday with a thread claiming large language models are 'glorified autocomplete' that merely predict text without true comprehension. His post, which has 250,000 views, directly challenged recent claims by Anthropic and OpenAI researchers about their models' reasoning capabilities.</p>
                    <p><strong>The battle lines:</strong> AI researcher Melanie Mitchell and linguist Emily Bender rallied behind Marcus, arguing that pattern matching isn't understanding, while DeepMind's Shane Legg and Anthropic's Chris Olah defended LLMs as exhibiting genuine comprehension through emergent behaviors. The hashtag #LLMsUnderstand has been trending for 18 hours with over 50,000 tweets.</p>
                    <p><strong>The stakes:</strong> The debate touches on fundamental questions about AI consciousness and capability claims that could influence billions in funding and regulatory decisions. Philosophy professors are joining the fray, with some arguing the question itself is unanswerable, while others insist it's crucial for determining AI rights and responsibilities.</p>

                <h3>Singapore Launches Mandatory AI Auditing Program for Banks</h3>
                <div class="card-content">
                    <p><strong>The regulation:</strong> Singapore's Monetary Authority announced new rules requiring all banks to conduct quarterly audits of AI systems used for lending, fraud detection, and customer service by July 2026. The regulations mandate human oversight for all AI decisions affecting customer accounts and require banks to maintain detailed logs of AI decision-making processes.</p>
                    <p><strong>The requirements:</strong> Banks must hire certified AI auditors and implement 'algorithmic impact assessments' before deploying new AI systems. The rules also require financial institutions to offer customers explanations for AI-driven decisions and establish appeal processes, with violations carrying fines up to 10% of annual revenue.</p>
                    <p><strong>The ripple effect:</strong> The Singapore framework is being closely watched by regulators in Hong Kong, Tokyo, and London as a potential model for AI governance in financial services. Major banks including DBS, UOB, and international firms with Singapore operations are scrambling to hire AI compliance experts, with salaries for qualified professionals jumping 60% in the past month.</p>

                <h3>Scientists Teach AI to Predict Protein Folding in Real-Time</h3>
                <div class="card-content">
                    <p><strong>The breakthrough:</strong> Researchers at UC Berkeley developed an AI system called 'FoldFast' that predicts how proteins will fold in just 30 seconds, compared to hours or days required by previous methods. The system uses a novel neural network architecture that mimics the physical forces acting on amino acid chains, achieving 94% accuracy on benchmark tests.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Protein folding determines how medications work, how diseases spread, and how biological processes function, but has been computationally expensive to predict. FoldFast could accelerate drug discovery by allowing researchers to test thousands of protein configurations rapidly, potentially reducing the timeline for developing new treatments from years to months.</p>
                    <p><strong>The applications:</strong> Pharmaceutical companies are already licensing the technology to design more effective antibiotics and cancer treatments. The research team estimates FoldFast could help identify new drug targets for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and rare genetic diseases by revealing how misfolded proteins contribute to these conditions.</p>
