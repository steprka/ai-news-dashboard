                <div class="card-content">
                    <p><strong>The trigger:</strong> Anthropic launched plug-ins for its Claude Cowork agent on Friday that automate tasks across <strong>legal, sales, marketing, and data analysis</strong>. The legal plug-in reviews documents, flags risks, handles NDA triage, and tracks compliance -- signaling Anthropic's shift from model supplier to workflow owner.</p>
                    <p><strong>The carnage:</strong> A Goldman Sachs basket of US software stocks sank 6%, its biggest one-day decline since April. <strong>Thomson Reuters plunged 18%</strong> (its worst day on record), RELX fell 14%, Wolters Kluwer dropped 13%, and LegalZoom crashed 19.7%. The Nasdaq 100 fell 2.4% at one point.</p>
                    <p><strong>The signal:</strong> "Recent months have seen a clear shift in markets from AI euphoria towards more differentiation between companies, and <strong>growing concern about its disruption to existing business models</strong>," said Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid. Anthropic frames the tool as an assistant, not a replacement -- but investors aren't buying it.</p>

                <div class="card-content">
                    <p><strong>The feature:</strong> X rolled out an AI image editor that lets users modify <strong>any image on the platform</strong> -- not just their own. Artists discovered the three-dot menu now includes "edit image" on every post, enabling strangers to alter their work or photos without consent.</p>
                    <p><strong>The backlash:</strong> "This doesn't just put artists at risk, it puts <strong>every Twitter user at risk</strong>," one creator wrote. "Anyone can use AI to edit images of real people posted on this platform, simply a family photo, past or present." Many artists are abandoning the platform entirely.</p>
                    <p><strong>Meanwhile, algorithmic chaos:</strong> Musk announced that Grok now ranks your Following feed by "predicted engagement" -- <strong>chronological order is dead</strong>. Critics argue this shift toward virality will amplify polarization and fundamentally change how the platform works.</p>

                <div class="card-content">
                    <p><strong>The partnership:</strong> Apple is paying Google <strong>~$1 billion per year</strong> to power the next-generation Siri with Gemini models. Tim Cook called it "a collaboration" -- Apple Intelligence still runs on-device and in Private Cloud Compute, but Gemini handles the conversational AI heavy lifting.</p>
                    <p><strong>How it works:</strong> The new Siri will have "on-screen awareness" and seamless cross-app integration, finally delivering the <strong>context-aware assistant</strong> Apple has promised for years. Apple tested OpenAI and Anthropic before choosing Google, and the deal isn't exclusive.</p>
                    <p><strong>The market impact:</strong> News of the partnership pushed <strong>Google's market cap to $4 trillion</strong> for the first time in intraday trading -- making it the fourth company to hit that milestone after Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. Apple reportedly plans to unveil Gemini-powered Siri this month.</p>

                <div class="card-content">
                    <p><strong>The beef:</strong> Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, responded on X to an "overexcited" post by OpenAI's Sébastien Bubeck about GPT-5 solving mathematical problems. Hassabis called the claims <strong>"embarrassing"</strong> -- a rare public shot between AI lab leaders that set off a firestorm of debate.</p>
                    <p><strong>The context:</strong> The spat reflects a growing tension as labs compete for talent, funding, and credibility. Critics note that <strong>social-media-fueled hype</strong> is increasingly driving AI narratives, often outpacing what the technology can actually deliver. MIT Technology Review devoted its Feb 4 newsletter to the phenomenon.</p>
                    <p><strong>The bigger picture:</strong> Allie K. Miller's viral 2026 predictions thread argues the real race isn't benchmarks -- it's <strong>context engineering and memory</strong>. "The race to help AI remember you, your work, and your preferences" will define which assistant actually becomes indispensable. Hot take: "Gen Z will get hit hardest by AI job displacement."</p>

                <div class="card-content">
                    <p><strong>The mega-round:</strong> Waymo closed <strong>$16 billion in funding</strong> led by Dragoneer, DST Global, and Sequoia, valuing the Alphabet-owned robotaxi company at $126 billion -- nearly triple its 2024 valuation. Andreessen Horowitz, Tiger Global, Fidelity, and Temasek also participated.</p>
                    <p><strong>The expansion:</strong> Waymo tripled its ride volume to <strong>15 million rides in 2025</strong> and now provides 400,000+ rides weekly across six US metros. The funding will fuel expansion to <strong>20+ cities in 2026</strong>, including Tokyo, London, Dallas, Houston, Denver, and Washington D.C.</p>
                    <p><strong>The competition heats up:</strong> Waymo is girding for battle with Amazon-backed Zoox in San Francisco and Tesla's robotaxi ambitions. Meanwhile, Day AI raised $20M to reinvent CRM with agents, Checkbox pulled in $23M for legal workflow AI, and Linq landed $20M for AI messaging assistants.</p>

                <div class="card-content">
                    <p><strong>The countdown:</strong> Trump's December executive order gave the FTC until <strong>March 11, 2026</strong> to issue a policy statement on how the FTC Act applies to AI. The Commerce Secretary faces the same deadline to identify "burdensome" state AI laws for potential federal preemption.</p>
                    <p><strong>Colorado delayed:</strong> The Colorado AI Act, which requires deployers of high-risk AI to use "reasonable care" against algorithmic discrimination, was <strong>pushed from February 1 to June 30, 2026</strong>. The law mandates impact assessments, transparency disclosures, and documentation of AI decision-making.</p>
                    <p><strong>The federal-state tension:</strong> The AG's new AI litigation task force is preparing to challenge state laws deemed inconsistent with federal policy. Meanwhile, <strong>Texas's TRAIGA</strong> took effect January 1, and California's whistleblower protections for AI safety concerns are now active.

                <div class="card-content">
                    <p><strong>The release:</strong> Allen Institute for AI dropped <strong>SERA</strong>, a family of open coding agents that adapt to any codebase -- including private repos. SERA-32B solves 54.2% of SWE-Bench Verified, beating prior open-source models. Total training cost: <strong>~$2,000 on 32 GPUs</strong>.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> SERA uses "Soft Verified Generation," a method <strong>26x cheaper than reinforcement learning</strong>. The models plug directly into Claude Code out of the box. AI2 released a February 3 update with SERA-14B and refreshed training datasets in model-agnostic format.</p>
                    <p><strong>The bigger shift:</strong> Google unveiled its AI Plus subscription featuring <strong>Gemini 3 Pro</strong> for content creation. Adobe shipped Firefly Boards, an AI-first canvas for real-time collaboration. And Faraday Future launched its "Robot & Vehicle +" robotics products today at NADA in Las Vegas.</p>

                <h3>DeepMind Open-Sources AlphaGenome — The AlphaFold of DNA</h3>
                <div class="card-content">
                    <p><strong>The breakthrough:</strong> Google DeepMind released <strong>AlphaGenome</strong>, an AI model that predicts the function of DNA sequences. Following AlphaFold's Nobel Prize-winning success with proteins, AlphaGenome represents a major leap in genomics -- and DeepMind has <strong>open-sourced the model</strong> for researchers worldwide.</p>
                    <p><strong>Self-verifying agents:</strong> The biggest obstacle to scaling AI agents -- error accumulation in multi-step workflows -- is being solved by <strong>self-verification</strong>. Instead of human oversight at every step, agents now use internal feedback loops to check their own work. This enables complex, reliable "auto-judging" workflows.</p>
                    <p><strong>World models are coming:</strong> LLMs predict the next word, but don't understand the physical world. Researchers believe the next leap will come from <strong>world models</strong> -- AI that learns how objects move and interact in 3D space. Signs are multiplying that 2026 will be the breakout year for this paradigm.</p>
