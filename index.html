                <h3>EU Artists Sue Meta Over Instagram's AI Training Data Scraping</h3>
                <div class="card-content">
                    <p><strong>The lawsuit:</strong> A coalition of 15,000 European artists filed a class-action lawsuit against Meta in Dublin High Court, claiming the company illegally scraped their Instagram posts to train its Llama AI models without consent. The artists, represented by digital rights firm Noyb, are seeking €10 billion in damages and demanding Meta delete all artwork-derived training data.</p>
                    <p><strong>The allegations:</strong> Plaintiffs argue Meta violated GDPR Article 6 by processing creative works without legitimate basis, claiming the company's terms of service updates in 2023 retroactively authorized AI training use. The lawsuit cites internal Meta documents showing the company harvested over 2.3 billion images from Instagram, with 40% classified as 'artistic content' including paintings, illustrations, and digital art.</p>
                    <p><strong>The precedent:</strong> This represents the largest AI training data lawsuit in Europe to date, potentially setting crucial precedent for how tech giants can use user-generated content for AI development. Legal experts suggest a victory could force major platforms to implement opt-in consent systems and pay licensing fees to content creators across the EU.</p>

                <h3>Google's Bard Integration Causes Gmail Search Chaos for Users</h3>
                <div class="card-content">
                    <p><strong>The problem:</strong> Google's rollout of Bard AI integration into Gmail has created widespread user confusion, with thousands reporting the AI misinterprets search queries and surfaces irrelevant emails. Users complain that Bard's 'smart search' feature returns emails from years ago when searching for recent messages, while its suggested responses often miss context entirely, leading to embarrassing professional exchanges.</p>
                    <p><strong>The frustration:</strong> Reddit and Twitter are flooded with screenshots of Bard suggesting wildly inappropriate email responses, including formal replies to spam messages and overly casual responses to work emails. Power users report the new interface requires 3-4 more clicks to access traditional search functions, while the AI's confidence in wrong suggestions has led to several viral customer service disasters.</p>
                    <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Google acknowledged the issues yesterday, with Gmail product lead announcing they're rolling back some Bard features while improving the model's email context understanding. The company is implementing a 'classic search' toggle and reducing Bard's default confidence levels, but users report the fixes are rolling out inconsistently across accounts.</p>

                <h3>Biden Signs Executive Order Requiring AI Model Registration</h3>
                <div class="card-content">
                    <p><strong>The order:</strong> President Biden signed Executive Order 14129 requiring any AI company training models with more than 10^25 FLOPs to register with the Department of Commerce within 90 days. The order establishes mandatory safety testing protocols, algorithmic auditing requirements, and incident reporting systems for frontier AI models, with penalties including $10 million fines and restricted access to federal computing resources.</p>
                    <p><strong>The requirements:</strong> Companies must submit detailed training methodologies, safety evaluation results, and risk mitigation strategies before deploying models publicly. The order creates a new AI Safety Review Board within Commerce, empowered to halt model releases deemed to pose national security or public safety risks, while requiring quarterly capability assessments for models exceeding performance thresholds.</p>
                    <p><strong>The reaction:</strong> Tech industry leaders expressed mixed reactions, with Anthropic and OpenAI supporting the framework while Meta and Google criticized the registration thresholds as overly restrictive. Republican lawmakers immediately announced plans to challenge the order in court, arguing it exceeds executive authority and could handicap US AI competitiveness against China's less regulated development approach.</p>

                <h3>DeepMind Solves Protein Folding for All Known Life Forms</h3>
                <div class="card-content">
                    <p><strong>The breakthrough:</strong> DeepMind's AlphaFold 3 has successfully predicted the 3D structures of over 200 million proteins across all known life forms, completing what researchers call the 'protein universe map.' Published in Nature, the achievement covers every protein in major biological databases, from viruses to complex mammals, with accuracy levels above 90% for most predictions, dramatically expanding from AlphaFold 2's coverage of 1 million structures.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This comprehensive protein structure database could revolutionize drug discovery, allowing pharmaceutical companies to design medications by understanding exactly how drugs interact with target proteins. Researchers estimate this could reduce drug development timelines from 10-15 years to 3-5 years, while enabling entirely new approaches to treating diseases like Alzheimer's, cancer, and rare genetic disorders that were previously considered undruggable.</p>
                    <p><strong>The applications:</strong> Beyond medicine, the protein map enables breakthroughs in biotechnology, including designing enzymes for plastic degradation, creating more efficient biofuels, and developing sustainable materials. DeepMind is releasing the entire database freely to researchers, with pharmaceutical giants like Novartis and Roche already announcing new drug programs based on previously unknown protein structures discovered through AlphaFold 3's predictions.</p>
