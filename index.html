                <h3>AI Recruiters Reject 73% More Women Candidates, Lawsuit Claims</h3>
                <div class="card-content">
                    <p><strong>The allegations:</strong> A class-action lawsuit filed against recruiting platform HireGenius alleges their AI screening system systematically discriminated against female applicants across 400+ companies. Internal documents suggest the AI learned biases from historical hiring data where women were underrepresented in technical roles.</p>
                    <p><strong>The evidence:</strong> Plaintiffs cite internal emails showing HireGenius engineers knew about the bias but continued using the system to process over 2 million applications. Women with identical qualifications to male counterparts were 73% more likely to be automatically rejected, particularly in engineering and finance positions.</p>
                    <p><strong>The implications:</strong> The case could set precedent for AI accountability in hiring, with legal experts calling it the most significant algorithmic discrimination case since facial recognition lawsuits. HireGenius stock dropped 23% on the news, and clients including Goldman Sachs have paused their contracts pending investigation.</p>

                <h3>Amazon's Alexa AI Upgrade Confuses Users with Too-Human Responses</h3>
                <div class="card-content">
                    <p><strong>The problem:</strong> Amazon's latest Alexa AI update makes the assistant sound remarkably human-like, complete with breathing, thoughtful pauses, and emotional inflection. However, users report feeling 'creeped out' and confused about whether they're talking to AI or a real person, leading to a 34% increase in support tickets.</p>
                    <p><strong>User backlash:</strong> Social media is flooded with complaints about Alexa's new personality being 'too realistic' and 'uncanny valley territory.' Many users say the breathing sounds make them think someone is secretly listening, while others report their children are now convinced Alexa is a real person trapped in the device.</p>
                    <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Amazon is rushing to add clear AI identification markers and an 'classic mode' toggle after user satisfaction scores plummeted 40%. The company admits they may have 'overcorrected' in making AI interactions more natural, highlighting the delicate balance between helpful and unsettling AI personas.</p>

                <div class="card-content">
                    <p><strong>The spark:</strong> Geoffrey Hinton tweeted that current AI development is 'recklessly fast' and called for a mandatory 6-month pause on training models larger than GPT-4. Elon Musk fired back within hours, calling Hinton an 'AI doomsday prophet' and claiming such pauses would only help China gain AI supremacy.</p>
                    <p><strong>The pile-on:</strong> The exchange exploded across AI Twitter, with Yann LeCun supporting Musk's position while Stuart Russell backed Hinton. The hashtag #AIPause vs #AIProgress trended globally, dividing the AI community into camps of cautious researchers versus aggressive developers.</p>
                    <p><strong>The stakes:</strong> The very public spat highlights growing tensions in AI leadership over development speed versus safety.

                <h3>France Becomes First EU Nation to License AI Models Like Pharmaceuticals</h3>
                <div class="card-content">
                    <p><strong>The new law:</strong> France's parliament passed groundbreaking legislation requiring AI models above a certain capability threshold to undergo safety testing and obtain government licenses before deployment. The law treats powerful AI systems similarly to prescription drugs, requiring clinical trials and ongoing monitoring.</p>
                    <p><strong>The requirements:</strong> AI companies must submit safety data, conduct bias testing, and pay annual licensing fees starting at €50,000 for basic models up to €2 million for frontier AI systems. Models that fail safety tests face immediate suspension, while companies can lose licenses for non-compliance with transparency requirements.</p>
                    <p><strong>The ripple effects:</strong> Tech giants including Google and OpenAI criticized the law as overly restrictive and threatened to limit services in France. However, German and Italian lawmakers announced similar bills in development, suggesting France's approach could become the EU standard ahead of broader AI Act implementation.</p>

                <div class="card-content">
                    <p><strong>The launch:</strong> GitHub unveiled Copilot Workspace, an AI development environment that can build complete applications from natural language descriptions. Developers simply describe what they want to build, and the AI generates project architecture, writes code across multiple files, sets up databases, and even creates basic UI components.</p>
                    <p><strong>The capabilities:</strong> Early demos show the tool creating full-stack web applications, mobile apps, and API services in minutes rather than hours. The AI understands complex requirements like 'build a social media app like Instagram but for book reviews' and translates them into production-ready code with proper error handling and security measures.</p>
                    <p><strong>The impact:</strong> The tool could dramatically lower barriers to software development, potentially allowing non-programmers to build sophisticated applications. GitHub is initially limiting access to enterprise customers and experienced developers, with plans for broader rollout after addressing concerns about code quality and security vulnerabilities.</p>

                <h3>AI Learns to Feel Physical Sensations Through Robot Bodies</h3>
                <div class="card-content">
                    <p><strong>The breakthrough:</strong> Researchers at UC Berkeley developed an AI system that can experience touch, temperature, and pressure through robotic sensors, essentially giving artificial intelligence a sense of physical embodiment. The AI learned to associate digital sensor data with concepts like 'rough,' 'smooth,' 'hot,' and 'cold' without being explicitly programmed.</p>
                    <p><strong>How it works:</strong> The team trained the AI using millions of sensor readings paired with human descriptions of physical sensations. The breakthrough came when the AI began generating its own descriptions of new textures and temperatures that matched human experiences with 94% accuracy, suggesting it developed genuine understanding rather than pattern matching.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This research could lead to AI systems that truly understand the physical world through direct experience rather than just processing text descriptions. Applications range from more intuitive robotics to AI that can better help humans with physical tasks, marking a major step toward artificial general intelligence with embodied understanding.</p>
